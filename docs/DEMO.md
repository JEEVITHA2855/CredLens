## üé¨ Demo Script (10 minutes)

### Opening (1 minute)
*"Today I'm excited to show you CredLens - an AI-powered tool that doesn't just detect misinformation, but teaches users how to become better fact-checkers themselves."*

**Show homepage and explain:**
- Clean, professional interface designed for education
- Accepts both text claims and article URLs
- Real-time analysis with educational insights

### Demo 1: False Claim Detection (2 minutes)

**Input this text:**
```
SHOCKING: Scientists REVEAL that 5G towers spread deadly coronavirus through radio waves! The mainstream media doesn't want you to know this TRUTH!
```

**Highlight the results:**

1. **Credibility Fingerprint**
   - Overall score: ~15% (Low credibility)
   - Language risk: High due to sensational words
   - Source credibility: Low (no credible sources)
   - Show the visual fingerprint with red indicators

2. **Evidence Analysis**
   - Status: "Likely False"
   - Multiple contradicting sources (WHO, medical journals)
   - Clear explanation of why this is false

3. **Educational Insights**
   - Suspicious phrases highlighted: "SHOCKING", "REVEAL", "deadly"
   - Micro-lesson on sensational language detection
   - Tips for verification: "Be wary of emotionally charged language"

*"Notice how the system doesn't just say 'this is false' - it teaches the user WHY it's false and how to spot similar misinformation."*

### Demo 2: True Claim for Contrast (1.5 minutes)

**Input this text:**
```
COVID-19 vaccines have been shown to be effective at preventing severe illness and hospitalization.
```

**Show the contrast:**
- High credibility score (~85%)
- Supporting evidence from CDC, medical journals
- No suspicious language detected
- Educational tip focuses on source verification
- Green indicators throughout the interface

*"The system provides balanced analysis - when claims are well-supported, it shows that clearly with high credibility scores and supporting evidence."*

### Demo 3: URL Analysis (2 minutes)

**Use a reputable news URL or demonstrate with:**
```
https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/vaccines-and-immunization
```

**Demonstrate:**
- Automatic content extraction from URL
- Main claim identification
- Source credibility assessment (WHO = high credibility)
- Domain-based trust scoring

*"CredLens can analyze entire articles, not just individual claims. It extracts key factual statements and evaluates them against our knowledge base."*

### Demo 4: Mixed Evidence Scenario (1.5 minutes)

**Input:**
```
Organic foods are significantly more nutritious and healthier than conventional foods.
```

**Highlight:**
- "Mixed" verdict with ~60% credibility
- Some supporting, some contradicting evidence
- Nuanced explanation about limited differences
- Educational tip about understanding research complexity

*"Not everything is black and white. CredLens handles nuanced topics where evidence is mixed, teaching users to think critically about complex issues."*

### Technical Deep-Dive (2 minutes)

**Show the architecture briefly:**
*"Under the hood, CredLens uses several AI components working together:"*

- **Claim Extraction**: NLP to identify factual statements
- **Semantic Search**: FAISS + sentence transformers for similarity
- **Evidence Matching**: Compare against 50+ curated fact-checks
- **NLI Verification**: RoBERTa model determines support/contradiction
- **Credibility Scoring**: Multi-factor assessment including sources, corroboration, language
- **Educational Engine**: Context-aware micro-lessons

**Key Innovation Points:**
- Credibility "fingerprint" visualization
- Educational micro-lessons tailored to failure modes
- Evidence clustering (support vs. contradict)
- Suspicious language highlighting

## üéØ Key Messages to Emphasize

### 1. Educational Focus
*"This isn't just another fact-checker - it's a teaching tool that makes users better at evaluating information themselves."*

### 2. Comprehensive Analysis
*"We go beyond simple true/false labels to show WHY something is credible or not, with visual credibility fingerprints."*

### 3. Real-World Ready
*"Built for hackathon constraints with pre-trained models, but production-ready with proper caching and optimization."*

### 4. User Experience
*"Professional UI designed for educational institutions, newsrooms, or anyone wanting to improve media literacy."*

## üí° Audience Q&A Preparation

### Common Questions

**Q: How accurate is the system?**  
A: "Our accuracy depends on having relevant fact-checks in the database. For covered topics, we achieve high precision by using multiple AI models and credible sources. The system is designed to be transparent about uncertainty."

**Q: How do you handle bias in training data?**  
A: "We use diverse, reputable sources across the political spectrum and clearly show our evidence sources. The system is designed to be transparent about its reasoning rather than making black-box decisions."

**Q: Can this scale to handle social media misinformation?**  
A: "Absolutely. The core architecture using FAISS and semantic search is highly scalable. We'd need to expand the fact-check database and add real-time processing for production social media use."

**Q: How do you keep the fact-check database updated?**  
A: "Currently manual curation for quality, but we're designing APIs to integrate with fact-checking organizations like Snopes, PolitiFact, and international partners."

### Technical Questions

**Q: Why FAISS over other vector databases?**  
A: "FAISS is optimized for similarity search and works well for our hackathon timeline. For production, we might consider Pinecone or Weaviate for additional features."

**Q: How do you handle different languages?**  
A: "Our current models are English-focused, but the architecture supports multilingual models. The sentence transformers library has excellent multilingual models we could swap in."
